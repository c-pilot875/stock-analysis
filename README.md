# stock-analysis Challenge 2
1. ## Overview of project
The purpose of this project was to analize stock data using a refactored code derived from the previous written code. The refactored code was to enable the User to select a year in an InputBox and display the 'Total Daily Volume' and 'Return' for all tickers for that specific year while a MsgBox displayed how fast the code ran. 

2. ## Results
Below are two images compairing the stock performance of 2017 and 2018 as well as the execution times of the refactored script.

3. ## Summary
      1. * ### Advantages of refactoring code
            - Use fewer lines of code
            - Ease of updating and debugging
            - Clearer to understand by end user
            - Run code faster
      1.  * ### Disadvantages of refactoring code
            - Takes considerable time and testing
            - Can become confusing to end user without proper commenting
      1.  * ### Pros and Cons of original and refactored VBA code
            - Pros of the original were: While following the steps in the module, it was clear to follow a pattern when it came to defining variables, selecting the reange or cells, and making conditionals. Each step had an explaination or comment.
            - Cons of the original were: There were a lot of lines of code, debugging was a challenge, and it became confusing where I was at on the worksheets.
            - Pros of the refactored were: causing the code to run faster with fewer lines of code, clearer to identify Variables and Values and referencing 'yearValues'
            - Cons of the refactor were: it took a long time for me to refactor this code, debugging was still a challenge, and I didnt initlaly understand how this could be better. After reseaching online on how to propperly loop arrays, I discovered I could have been using the 'immediate window' or print.debug, this entire time to see how each line of code was working on the sheet. This would have made it easier for me to understand the mapping of the code instead of writing, hitting play and crossing my fingers.
