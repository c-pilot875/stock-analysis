# stock-analysis Challenge 2
1. ## Overview of project
The purpose of this project was to analize stock data using a refactored code derived from the previous written code. The refactored code was to enable the User to select a year in an InputBox and display the Total Daily Volume and Return for all tickers for that specific year while a MsgBox displayed how fast the code ran. 

2. ## Results
Below are two images comapiring the stock performance of 2017 and 2018 as well as the execution times of the refactored script.

3. ## Summary
      1. * ### Advantages of refactoring code
            - Use fewer lines of code
            - Ease of updating and debugging
            - Clearer to understand by end user
            - Run code faster
      1.  * ### Disadvantages of refactoring code
            - Takes considerable time and testing
            - Can become confusing to end user without proper commenting
      1.  * ### Pros and Cons or refactoring the original VBA code
            - Pros were: causing the code to run faster with fewer lines of code, clearer to identify Variables and Values and referencing yearValues
            - Cons were: it took a long time for me to refactor this code, debugging was a challenge, and I didnt initlaly understand how this could be better
